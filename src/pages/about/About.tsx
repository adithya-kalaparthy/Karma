          Julia Lyle will have nothing to do with domineering men, no matter how
          tall, dark, and sexy. But Dom Marcus Cavendish will be satisfied with
          nothing less than collaring the fiercely independent Julia.

          Julia Lyle is invited to her best friend’s wedding and is stunned when
          Lana kneels to accept her husband’s collar. When Julia starts to
          object, firm, relentless hands land on her shoulders. The man behind
          her threatens to turn her over his knee if she interrupts. She’s
          outraged, but there’s no doubt he’s serious.
